<br>

This project works with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.



## Project Details
In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,
<br>
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single score for each episode.
<br>
The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.

## Getting Started
It is recommended to follow the Udacity DRL ND dependencies [instructions here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) 

This project utilises [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 

A prebuilt simulator is required in be installed. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)


The file needs to placed in the root directory of the repository and unzipped.

Next, before starting the environment utilising the corresponding prebuilt app from Udacity  **Before running the code cell in the notebook**, change the `file_name` parameter to match the location of the Unity environment that you downloaded.

## Instructions
Then run the [`Tennis.ipynb`](https://github.com/sand47/DRLND-Continuous-Control/blob/master/DDPG_Continuous_Control.ipynb) notebook using the drlnd kernel to train the DDPG agent.

Once trained the model weights will be saved in the checkpoints directory with filenames as `checkpoint_actor.pth` and `checkpint_critic.pth`.

Read the report file for more details about the description of the implementation and a plot of rewards per episode.
